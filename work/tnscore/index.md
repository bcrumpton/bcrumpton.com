The Volkert website utilizes Wordpress as a backend with a slightly different take on the theme development. Timber by Upstatement is a theme separates templating from the logic. Timber uses the Twig templating engine in tandem with HTML to write your template structure. All logic is still mostly handled within PHP. I really enjoyed working in Timber because it reinforces MVC & DRY principles.
